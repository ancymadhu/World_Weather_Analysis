# World_Weather_Analysis
## Project Overview
Desiging the travel app - 'PlanMyTrip' which gives weather description and weather data of places. Then, we'll have the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose particular cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between these cities as well as a marker layer map.
